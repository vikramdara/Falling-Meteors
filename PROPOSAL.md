# [Falling Meteors]

Author: [Vikram Dara]

For this project I want to build a game where there is a screen where meteors are continuously falling from the sky. In this case it would 
be from the top of the screen. The user will be an entity that will have to dodge the meteors by moving left or right.
There will be multiple levels to the game with each consecutive level becoming more and more difficult. There will be 4 levels. 

I want to do this because it seems like a fun project idea with lots of flexibity for additions such as elevating the ground so there is 
less time to react, meteors falling in different directions etc. 

For the libraries that I would use, I am planning on using the physics library Box2d, so I can deal with collision, flow of the 
meteors, and sprite movements. I will use cinder to deal with sprite and meteor images.

I plan to be done with sprite physics by the first week along with all the GUI implementation, then for the second week I would aim to 
finish all the meteor physics and collision physics. Finally for the third week I want to finish the 4 level system. If I finish early I 
would add logic for the additions I mentioned above, elevating the ground so there is less time to react, meteors falling in different 
directions, etc.
